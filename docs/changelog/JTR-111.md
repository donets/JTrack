# JTR-111

- Date: 2026-02-27
- Scope: add Team Invitations tab

## What changed

- Enhanced `apps/web/pages/team/index.vue` with primary Team tabs:
  - `Members`
  - `Invitations` (with count badge)
- Kept member filtering (`All / Active / Invited`) as a secondary tab set inside `Members`.
- Added Invitations table with required columns:
  - `Email`
  - `Name`
  - `Role`
  - `Invited Date`
  - `Status`
  - actions (`Resend`, `Revoke`)
- Wired post-invite behavior so successful invite switches UI to the `Invitations` tab.
- Added follow-up entries in UI plan and marked `JTR-111` as complete.

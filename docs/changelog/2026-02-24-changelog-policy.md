# 2026-02-24: Changelog Conflict Prevention

- Moved routine delivery changelog responsibility out of `AGENTS.md` into `docs/changelog/*`.
- Added `docs/changelog/README.md` with per-issue/per-date logging rules.
- Migrated legacy inline `AGENTS.md` changelog entries to `docs/changelog/archive-2026-02.md`.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` policy so it is edited only for process/rule changes.

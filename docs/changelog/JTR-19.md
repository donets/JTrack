# JTR-19

- Date: 2026-02-25
- Scope: prevent sync pull from echoing records just pushed by the same client cycle

## What changed

- Updated web sync flow (`apps/web/stores/sync.ts`):
  - pull baseline remains the persisted `lastPulledAt` (pre-push checkpoint) to avoid dropping concurrent remote updates created during the push window
  - pull response is locally filtered to suppress push-echo records by comparing pushed IDs and response `updatedAt` timestamps against push `newTimestamp`
  - echo-suppression code paths are now generated by iterating over shared `entityCollections` (no per-entity copy-paste blocks)
  - echo suppression state is built only when outbox is non-empty (only when push actually happens)
- Shared sync pull contract (`packages/shared/src/sync.ts`) remains unchanged: `SyncPullRequest` does not include `clientId`.
- Updated tests:
  - `apps/web/stores/sync.spec.ts` verifies pull keeps pre-push baseline, filters echoed upserts at `updatedAt === pushTimestamp`, and suppresses echoed deletes
  - `packages/shared/src/sync.spec.ts` covers pull request defaults and cursor parsing
- Updated sync API/design documentation and data models.

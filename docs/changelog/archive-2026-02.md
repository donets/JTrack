- 2026-02-24: Fixed CI web test failure for missing `.nuxt/tsconfig.json`: `apps/web` test script now runs `nuxt prepare` before `vitest`.
- 2026-02-24: CI test workflow trigger scope adjusted: `pnpm test` now runs on all pull requests and on pushes to `main`/`develop`.
- 2026-02-24: Fixed API typecheck baseline errors: removed direct Prisma enum imports from `prisma/seed.ts`, added explicit service callback/transaction typing across API modules, and aligned docs for type-safety quality gate.

- 2026-02-24: JTR-11 completed: API/Web Dockerfiles migrated to multi-stage builds, `docker/.dockerignore` added, and Render docker command aligned with lean runtime image startup.

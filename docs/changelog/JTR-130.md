# JTR-130

- Date: 2026-03-02
- Scope: improve attachment drag-and-drop upload zone with multi-file flow and per-file progress

## What changed

- Updated attachments drop zone copy and behavior:
  - supports selecting/dropping multiple files in one action,
  - web file input now uses `multiple`.
- Added per-file upload progress/status tracking on ticket detail:
  - shows uploading percentage while processing,
  - final statuses per file (`Done` / `Failed`) with progress bars.
- Refactored upload flow:
  - uploads each selected file through `useAttachmentAdapter.uploadAttachment()`,
  - runs a single sync after batch completion (instead of syncing per file),
  - shows summary toast for success/partial failures.
- Existing dragover highlight behavior is preserved.
